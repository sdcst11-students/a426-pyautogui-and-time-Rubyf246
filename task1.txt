Explain what it does. What do the different lines do?

time.time()   # This line shows the seconds since the epoch time: January 1, 1970.
                    It shows the seconds in a float value 
    An example is:
             x = time.time() # this will put the epoch time into the variable "x".
             print(x)  # this is then print the float value out.

time.sleep()   # This line will essentionally make the program not do anything ("sleep") 
                for the amount of seconds that is in the parentheses
    An example is: 
            time.sleep(3.5) # this will make the program sleep for 3.5 seconds before continuing with the program.
            print("I went to sleep for 3.5 seconds")  # this prints that 3.5 seconds has past since the program slept.

now = time.time() # this is the same as x= time.time()
print(f"elapsed time: {now - x} seconds") # this prints how much time has elapsed since "x" and "now"

Explain what it does. Give a brief summary of the program
and explain the importance of each line.

This program runs 

import time

# time can also be used to create a list of alarms

alarms = [0,0,0]
delays = [10,20,60]
start = time.time()
alarms[0] = start + delays[0]
alarms[1] = start + delays[1]
alarms[2] = start + delays[2]

while True:
    for i in range(0,3):
        now = time.time()
        if now > alarms[i]:
            print(f"alarm {i} {delays[i]} second alarm has been triggered because now ({round(now,3)}) > alarm {i} {round(alarms[i],3)}")
            alarms[i] = now + delays[i]
    time.sleep(1)
    print(f"time elapsed is {round(time.time() - start,3)}")
